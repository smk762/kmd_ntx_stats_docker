'''
This script scans the blockchain for notarisation txids that are not already recorded in the database.
After updaing the "notarised" table, aggregations are performed to get counts for notaries and coins within each season.
It is intended to be run as a cronjob every 15-30 min
Script runtime is around 5-10 mins, except for initial population which is up to 1 day per season
